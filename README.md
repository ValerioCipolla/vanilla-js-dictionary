# Vanilla JS Dictionary

Originally made as a project for SchoolOfCode, I spent some additional time to refactor and modify the code and add some new features.

Use this web App to look up english words and find out how to pronounce them (audio file included), their meanings and origins.

I used a web API to fetch the words and their properties, and I added responsiveness to make it look good both on small and big devices.
